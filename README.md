### ‚úÇÔ∏è New Seamless Stitching Mode

Introducing the **Seamless Stitching** feature! This advanced mode eliminates gaps between clips, outputting a single continuous video where every device flip is pre-edited for you. The result? A perfectly smooth, uninterrupted final clip that automatically handles your orientation changes without missing a beat.

This revolutionary update combines every clip into one length-perfect recording, so you no longer need to manually edit or align clips. Just capture and let **GyroCam** handle the rest!

## The Story Behind GyroCam 

GyroCam was born from a personal need. As someone living with bipolar depression, memory challenges, and processing past traumas, I found vlogging to be a powerful tool for preserving memories and making sense of my experiences. These video journals became my external memory bank - allowing me to revisit moments that would otherwise fade away.
But there was a problem: every time I flipped my phone to switch between showing my face and my perspective, the orientation would change. What should have been a healing practice became a technical nightmare, with hours spent manually finding, splitting, and rotating segments - sometimes 10-20 orientation changes per minute of footage.
GyroCam is my solution: an app that intelligently handles orientation changes as you record, eliminating hours of frustrating post-production work. What began as a personal tool to make my mental health journey easier has evolved into something I believe can help content creators, memory-keepers, and storytellers everywhere.
Every feature in this app was designed with one goal: to let you focus on capturing your story, not wrestling with technology.
