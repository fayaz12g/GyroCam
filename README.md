## About GyroCam 🧭

GyroCam revolutionizes mobile videography by automatically handling device orientation changes. Our unique **Auto-Orientation System** stops and restarts recording every time you rotate your device, ensuring perfect portrait/landscape alignment in every clip.

Key Innovation:  
✅ **Orientation Lock** - Maintains natural perspective during complex movements  
✅ **Seamless Restart** - Instant recording continuation after rotation  
✅ **Clip Stitching** (Beta) - Automatically combines related clips during export
