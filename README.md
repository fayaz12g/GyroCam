## About GyroCam 🧭

GyroCam revolutionizes mobile videography by automatically handling device orientation changes. Our unique **Auto-Orientation System** stops and restarts recording every time you rotate your device, ensuring perfect portrait/landscape alignment in every clip.

Key Innovation:  
✅ **Orientation Lock** - Maintains natural perspective during complex movements  
✅ **Seamless Restart** - Instant recording continuation after rotation

### ✂️ New Seamless Stitching Mode

Introducing the **Seamless Stitching** feature! This advanced mode eliminates gaps between clips, outputting a single continuous video where every device flip is pre-edited for you. The result? A perfectly smooth, uninterrupted final clip that automatically handles your orientation changes without missing a beat.

This revolutionary update combines every clip into one length-perfect recording, so you no longer need to manually edit or align clips. Just capture and let **GyroCam** handle the rest!
